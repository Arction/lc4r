# Creating a pull request

GitHub pull requests are a place to propose concrete code changes to the package.

Anyone can create their own version of the package source code, publish it in GitHub in the form of a pull request and discuss with the package maintainers if this change could be integrated into the official package version.

Before creating a new pull request, please check the [list of existing pull requests](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/pulls) in case there is already on-going discussion about the same or related topic.

Additionally, it can be valuable to know if there is [an existing issue](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/issues) that is related to the proposed changes.

## Guidelines for creating pull requests

Pull requests should exist for improving the package in any way:

- Resolve an [issue](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/issues)
- Improve usage syntax
- Integrate to work together with some other R package
- Add new feature
- Modify existing feature to work better or more intuitively

**Be sure to describe in the pull request description, what does it aim to improve?**

- When modifying existing features, include descriptions of current behavior and proposed behavior (including code snippets and pictures of produced data visualization)

New pull requests can be created [here](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/compare)
