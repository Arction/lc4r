# Creating an issue

GitHub issues are a place to categorize free communication between users and maintainers based on the subject.

Before creating a new issue, please check the [list of existing issues](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/issues) in case there is already on-going discussion about the same or related topic.

## Guidelines for creating new issues

Issues should exist for addressing some goal - something which you would like the package to solve.

**Be sure to describe in the issue description what you would like to achieve**:

- How do you expect the package to behave? (code snippet and expected visualization)
- How does the package currently behave?

New issues can be created [here](https://github.com/Arction/lcjs4r/issues/new)
